# Final-Game-Repo
The repo for the final game project for Intro to Game Development

[Itch.io page](https://thomas-lim.itch.io/proplift)  
[Trello board](https://trello.com/b/Jq1zLibC/proplift-working-title) for this game  
Note: The "proposal" for this game that was previously in the README is now on this repository's wiki.

Thanks for everything, Karina and Jenny! I wish you both all the best.

The music I used was:
- I'm a Believer (Synthpop Cover) by Hot Dad
- Bud's Theme by Lewis Griffin (off the soundtrack for Grow Home)

Proplift is intended to be played in 16:9 resolution. Any other aspect ratio, I can't promise that things won't look wonky.

Some stuff that I wish I did better:
- I intended to have more backgrounds and to switch between them with the music changing in between each one
  - The currently implemented transition is basically just a proof of concept
  - Although it was hard enough doing this because I'm very bad at drawing, and I'm not very good at looking for game music.
- I want to refactor some of the tile swapping logic because there are occasionally some visual gitches that look bad
- The ending that I have implemented is basically an afterthought at this point, to be honest. 
- There's *probably* a better way to spawn all of the flowers outside of the game board.
- I think the gameplay might be missing an extra layer of challenge or interest. 
- There needs to be more sound variety, I think. I built a small thing that lets you add sounds into the inspector that adds them into a dictionary, and a function can be called to play a one shot of a random sound in an array of similar sounds from the dictionary based on a string you passed into it. Kind of proud of that one.
